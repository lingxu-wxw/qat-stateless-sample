	  Creates virtual block devices called /dev/zramX (X = 0, 1, ...).
	  Pages written to these disks are compressed and stored in memory
	  itself. These disks allow very fast I/O and compression provides
	  good amounts of memory savings.

	  It has several use cases, for example: /tmp storage, use as swap
	  disks and maybe many more.

	  See zram.txt for more information.

	By default zram uses stream-based compression so it can use
	every CPU only if every CPU has streams. However, it gives
	poor performance on single-stream workload.

	This implementation uses a background thread per core and
	compress a stream by multiple core.

	You can disable the feature "echo 0 > /sys/block/zramx/use_aio"
	before setting disksize.
